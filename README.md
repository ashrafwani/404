# 404-concept
A 404 concept page using the classic white noise for no signal from an analogue television set.

Makes use of a trick with `canvas` to generate a `canvas` that displays the white noise and then use this as a background image for `document.body`. Updating the `background-position` on animation frame gives the illusion of movement.

Enjoy!
